Transforming Credit Card Analytics with Power BI, SQL, and DAX

In today's fast-evolving financial landscape, data-driven decision-making is essential for optimizing customer engagement and revenue management. We developed a comprehensive Credit Card Transaction & Customer Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, SQL, and DAX to provide deep insights into transaction patterns, revenue streams, and customer behaviors.

📊 Key Insights from the Dashboard:

1️⃣ Customer Segmentation & Spending Behavior

The dashboard categorizes customers based on education, occupation, and spending patterns to understand behavioral trends.

Insights reveal which customer groups contribute the most to revenue, helping financial institutions design personalized offers and marketing strategies.


2️⃣ Transaction & Revenue Analysis

The report provides a quarterly analysis of credit card transactions, tracking revenue growth and transaction volume over time.

Revenue breakdown by expenditure categories (Bills, Entertainment, Fuel, Grocery, Travel, etc.) helps identify high-usage spending areas.

Mode of transactions (Swipe, Chip, Online) provides insights into how customers prefer to use their credit cards.


3️⃣ Credit Card Performance Metrics

The dashboard evaluates revenue generated per card type (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum) to assess their contribution to total earnings.

Interest earnings vs. transaction volume help analyze profitability across different customer segments.


4️⃣ Behavioral Trends & Risk Assessment

Detects high-risk transactions based on spending anomalies and unusual patterns.

Tracks spending consistency across different customer categories to differentiate between high-value customers and occasional spenders.


5️⃣ Business Impact & Decision-Making
